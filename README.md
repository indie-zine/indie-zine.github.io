## Building/prerequisites

In order to build the site, you'll need ruby installed (I recommend installing with [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/)), and some plugins.

```
gem install jekyll bundler jekyll-paginate jekyll-archives
```

Now you can build and view the site locally with

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
