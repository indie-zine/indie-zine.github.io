###### An adventure scenario usable for your systems of choice. It is, however, technically compatible with  [Blessed Art Thou](https://tagoymakes.com/blog/tabletop/blessed-art-thou/) and [Wanton Pinoy Spaghetti](https://pinoyspaghettigame.carrd.co/). Otherwise, you just need a spell list of your choice and whatever abstractions and resolutions you prefer for anything else. Lastly, this is best run with a group of players and one GM.

# The Premise

## Who and where are you?

You are a citizen of the city of ***Roxas***, famous for its sunflowers, and are, therefore, a countryman of ***The Pearlescent Isles***. Your country has just been *acquired* by new lords known as the ***Yunidos States***. You and your friends are practitioners of the Traditions, magical arts which have survived centuries of rule by the ***Qastila*** by taking on the trappings of the ***Katolique*** faith.

You all care enough about your fellow human beings that you will not sit idly by as they suffer.

## What's happening?
Dairy does not last long in the tropics. While delicious, everything derived from dairy, especially yogurt, spoils overnight. Several practitioners in Roxas, including yourself or a good friend, have found a way to preserve the dairy by indefinitely chilling it through Prayers to Saints able to evoke cold. Practitioners in the village of ***Metaas*** in the northern hills have found a way, through their Traditions, to preserve dairy by slowing its relative time for a period of two weeks. Combined, dairy and even other foods can last a month or longer. Talk of these methods have traveled across the lands at the speed of gossip.

Meanwhile, ***Manifest Technologies***, has invented the ***refrigerator***. It requires the following:
- A large sum of money to purchase the machine
- A large supply of energy to power the machine
- Every household that purchases a refrigerator must be on the ***Mana Grid*** for the power supply

The mana grid is primarily powered by the combusted life energies of inedible crops from industrialized farms. The extraction of the life energies from these inedible crops is efficient to the point of inconvenience.

The entire city of Roxas is transitioning to the Mana Grid by mandate of the Yunidos States. Manifest Technologies will sell their refrigerators to the captured market.

## What's the problem?
Manifest Technologies rather not have local competition. The village of Metaas has refused to sell their method of preserving dairy and other foods to Manifest Technologies. Their culture is not capital.

The sister company Destiny Energy plans to build a ***mana harvesting dam*** upstream the river near Metaas's agricultural lands. This will starve the whole community and eventually displace them.

The construction of the dam is public knowledge and even the regional Governor has approved the project.

## Your place in all this?

**You can stop this.**

# The Locations and Logistics

## The Village of Metaas

### General Things
- Once the elders have greeted you and confirmed you as a fellow practitioner of The Traditions, you will be greeted with fanfare and children will merrily crowd and greet you while some ask you funny questions about the things you carry or your appearance.
- A small majority of the population are children and young adults. The elders of the village are few but highly venerated and cared for.
- They are usually friendly to strangers, but targeted harassment from Manifest Tech goons has left them wary and weary.
- The village itself is a 5 day journey from Roxas with a small group on horseback and cart.
- The villagers have nothing but old hunting rifles and are inexperienced with violence.
- Their Traditions are devoid of Spells meant to harm others.
- No one in the village is fluent in English and only a few are capable of Tagalog; otherwise, they only know their native tongue.
- They are able to send messages over long distances through their Whispering Stone in the center of the village.
	- One requires a Herald's Agimat to send a message to the Whispering Stone from long distances
	- The Whispering Stone then writes the messages down in its spoken language on a medium provided the Stone
	- It faintly glows at night and is the site for many of the village's rituals
	- its origins are told through sung epics

- **Kuya Boy** — local Keeper of the Traditions and Scribe to the Whispering Stone
	- He is the only one able to create and bequeath a Herald's Agimat
	- He records and preserves each and every message which has passed through the Whispering Stone
	- Before he was the Scribe, while he was still training, he sent a message through the Stone confessing his love to his past childhood sweetheart; it's recorded on a gold tablet somewhere in Kuya Boy's house.

### Manifest Tech Goon Incident Table

## The Mana Harvesting Dam
### General Things
- The construction site is half a day's journey away from the village on horseback at a brisk pace.
- The forests stripped bare of life; the whirring of massive machines striking against wood and steel; the sour look armed guards give everyone; and frowning laborers toiling to the point of alienation
- 6d6 guards roaming the site at any one time
- d66+20 construction workers in total on site at any given time
- The contractor for the dam is a third-party lead by a Dennis Villanueva.
	- he's lodging in a villa positioned to overlook the entire construction project
	- an advanced magical barrier guards the villa; it only allows guests that Dennis has invited prior
	- the villa runs on an independent mana generator which powers both the villa's amenities and the barrier
	- a gold vein was recently found near the dam during one of the prior site surveys; almost no one knows this

### Characters of Some Significance
- **Dennis Villanueva** ⁠— Project Lead on the Dam's Construction
	- fiercely sycophantic dedication to the job
	- will easily capitulate to any threats of violence against him
	- always accompanied by 2d4 armed bodyguards wielding brass knuckles and folding shotguns
	- bodyguards and other attendant's are housed in "servant's" quarters in the villa
	- has plans to create a gold mine independent of Destiny Energy or Manifest Tech after the contract is completed; neither of the latter will be happy should they ever learn of this
	- intends to screw Governor Po-on out of the gold mine as well
- **Hired Security** ⁠— The goons of Destiny Energy
	- very well paid ex-police or ex-military
	- big, boorish, and heavily armed
	- trigger happy sons of bitches eager for an excuse to enact violence
- **The Construction Workers**  ⁠— Tired and full of uncertainty
	- heinously underpaid and the food they're given is awful
	- no job security due to being on a limited contract only
	- some are eager for a union, others are eager to just leave, and all need money

## Roxas City
### General Things
- A bustling port city and, therefore, a cultural melting pot.
- Famous for its sunflowers; an import from centuries ago; the deluge of flowers greet every traveler to the storied town whose Traditions have kept the sunflowers blooming and evidently prevalent throughout the entire city; it's bad luck to open a store without sunflowers in a vase somewhere.
- The neoclassical colonial architecture being overtaken by the harsher and grander decorations of Art Deco; a well-to-do man rides a carriage being pulled by a laborer; old world elites are able to purchase newfangled automobiles which attracts interest from pedestrians.
- The population is largely apathetic to the construction of the dam except for a few student activist groups and the city councilor Ernesto Diaz.
- News outlets that have reported on the dam's construction have not reported on its effect on the nearby village of Metaas.
- Governor Salvatore "Sunny" Po-on's family's construction company is working on the dam; he is eager to have it completed.
- Due to Manifest Tech's presence in the city, there are Yunidos Troops here along with a semi-permanent Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI) office; all here to safeguard Yunidos State interests.
