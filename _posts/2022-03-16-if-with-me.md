HELLO and welcome to the first chapter _IF with me_! This is going to be an on-going workshop about writing your first interactive fiction, whether physical or digital. Over the course of these episodes, I&#39;m going to be making a simple interactive fiction story from beginning to end, and I encourage you to follow along and make one with me! Feel free to ask any questions you may have, etc. etc. You know the drill.

[Here&#39;s](https://librivore42.itch.io/redacted) an example of the kind of thing you can make. It&#39;s not very horizontal, all the choices affect the world around you from your spot rather than where you go and want you see. That&#39;s just one of the many fun ways you could tell a story.

# Step One: The How

Before we get into anything at all, let&#39;s get you familiar with your TOOLS. There&#39;s several free programs that allow you to make this sort of thing, standouts include Ink and Twine, but we&#39;ll be using Twine for now. You can get it at [https://twinery.org/](https://twinery.org/)

Now open it up and let&#39;s do one minor point of housekeeping. Create a new game by clicking the &#39;+ story&#39; button and give it a name. Now navigate to the arrow at the bottom left and select &#39;Change Story Format&#39;. Change it to one of the Sugarcube options, trust me if we all use one format it&#39;ll be much easier later on.

Ready? Alright, let&#39;s get to it!. The twine layout is sort of like a mind map, very good for visual organization, especially when things start to get complicated. You have a starting box that links to other boxes, and the reader gets bounced from box to box, reading what&#39;s inside and making choices to decide where to go next. Each box contains a passage of text and some choices, but right now there&#39;s only one box on screen - Twine has a passage pre-made for you, so double-click it.

That&#39;s nice, but we want to give our readers something to do, so let&#39;s make a CHOICE. Choice points are simple. Any text in double square brackets [[like this]] becomes an option for the player to click. So let&#39;s add a few - for example, [[go left]] and [[go right]].

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-03-16-if-with-me/image01.png)

Close the passage and OH MY GOD

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-03-16-if-with-me/image02.png)

Good grief it&#39;s aliiiiiiiiiveeeee. Twine has made two new passages for us! This gives us room for more text and, more importantly, more choices. The arrows tell us that &quot;Go left&quot; and &quot;Go right&quot; come from the starting box, which helps us keep all of the passages and how they&#39;re linked up in our head. Click the play button to test out your game and you&#39;ll see that each choice is a hyperlink that takes you to different &#39;pages&#39; of the story.

Congratulations, you&#39;ve now made the world&#39;s simplest piece of interactive fiction! But we need a way to sort the rest of the story out before we go nuts with all these choices!

# Step 2: The What

The standard way to go about a narrative is to have a character whose choices affect the story and push it forward. Of course that&#39;s not the only way to go about it. You can have interactive fiction that is just about exploring a space or creating an experience. Maybe you can be really wild and let the player choose WHO makes a decision out of several characters, without being able to know or control what they&#39;ll do.

(That&#39;s a neat idea, I&#39;ll note that down for later)

But for now, let&#39;s go for the standard model. It can be tempting to jump in without a plan, but branching narratives can very quickly get out of control that way as pictured here:

Why no, I haven&#39;t even slightly reached the first major plot point. Let&#39;s not talk about it.

So! You will need the following basic ingredients:

A character

A goal

An obstacle

By the end of my story, I want my character (a duck) to reach their goal (delicious snails) by besting their obstacle (a very rude goose).

The story as you would want to tell it is the basic spine of your interactive fiction, so let&#39;s define that first. Grab some paper and a pen, and begin defining the beats of your story like so:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-03-16-if-with-me/image04.png)

This not only gives you a very strong idea of how to structure your story, but gives you very natural points from which the story can branch into other options. The old adventure game books would kill you almost immediately if you made the wrong decision, or locked you into a bad ending that would take a little time to play out. And while you don&#39;t HAVE to do that, nobody is stopping you. Here, let&#39;s create some dead (aha) ends and one choice that takes a while.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-03-16-if-with-me/image05.png)

That&#39;s all for part one. Show me what your plan looks like! In part two we&#39;ll set the scene of our first passage, and talk about different _ways_ the player can interact with the text, how much choice is too much choice, and why sometimes it&#39;s a good idea to have some purely cosmetic options.
