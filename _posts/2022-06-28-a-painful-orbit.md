# A painful orbit

```
I’d been setting one place at the table
Much longer than two
But you started to feel like a lifelong memory
Still setting two, sitting alone
						
							We were still friends, once
							Many yesterdays ago
							When did I become a stranger
							Feeling so alone at your table?

My phone needs space for new memories
That aren’t ugly angles and unflattering light
You were never good at photography
I hate them, and kept them all

							We could laugh, once
							Until you thought I was laughing at you
							When did you start to see just my mistakes
							Instead of me?

I can’t remember when we met
								We met a lifetime ago
I was always unhappy
								You became so unhappy

I thought you could help
							
								I needed help too


I’m still alone, more than ever
								
								
								We could have been better


Yesterday you loved me



								But did you ever love me?
