# How I learned to make better coffee

```
I wanted something akin to maturity, the bold
bugbear that nags inexorably at my thoughts:
am I mature enough? I don't know, ask those
I've lived with, and I haven't really lived
			with many people.

I was a stranger at times, perplexingly so, to you whom I preferred.
That's not great is it? It really isn't because whenever I asked this
It was after I'd done something bad and it happened to be my fault.

Worst of all, coffee I brewed would taste overly sour as if I were being punished,
(as if) I deserved it. I really should have stopped counting comeuppances
against me. Though there were some things I should not have lost
count of, among them were the times you willingly talked to me.
Your volition scared and scarred me to the point of ecstasy.
I had no volition of the sort and it, of course, blew up in my face.

The not unusual story of providing something contrary to what the other party
wanted. I bore shields that spoke of nothing profound about myself for
the longest time, the act got old fast, as old as sin, and my sins were borne
by my soul to the point of your apparent boredom, not your fault.
I'd have wanted to tear my eyes out too if I were in your shoes.
My lamentations weren't exciting in the adventurous sort of way and
adventure was evidently not in any of my names, something you've
			hopefully crossed with an "X" on your final list.

She found someone, folks. Someone who has nothing but a sword and an open heart.
I can't help but be happy at that fact. I am not cut out for coveting and all the nasty things
that follow. It's almost preferable that I had chosen nothing akin to maturity, a sad, sordid truth:
			I am at least now someone who,
			unlike that self in that one nightmare
			after a day or two of forgetting my meds,
			now has better coffee.
