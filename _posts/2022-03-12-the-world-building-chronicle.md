Welcome! I&#39;m D.M.G., and here in this Chronicle, I will be talking about world building, that is, how to build a world and fill it up, in multiple ways. All of this will be based upon my own experience, which I will try to detail as much as I can. As we go on, we will get more and more specific with the world building process, basically zooming into the world more and more as we progress, going from the global setting, onto a country, maybe talking about fauna and so on.

 With that being said, let&#39;s go!

Seeing as I deem it best to learn by doing, let&#39;s start by drawing a map. You don&#39;t need anything special or fancy softwares to do so, I&#39;ll personally be using Paint.net for it all.

Now, why start with the map you might be asking? Well, that way you will be able to get ideas and a feel for what it is you want to do with your world in the long run, though this is not to say you have to get everything in here from the get-go, far from it. Adjustments can always be made as you go on.

So here we have a blank slate. It&#39;s a good moment to think about how things will be for your world. That is to say, will you make it a planet like our Earth? Will it be a flat plane? Will it be covered by oceans or will it be a dusty desert? Will its emerging parts be broken apart or will they be connected or even merged to one another?

You need not to rush yourself with these questions, but they can help you shape your ideas.

I personally like Earth-like planets the most.

 Now, let&#39;s go on and draw a continent! Feel free to take inspiration from other fantasy maps, or even the Earth&#39;s map. For that matter, don&#39;t be afraid to get a bit weird with the shapes. After all, Italy is shaped like a high-heeled boot!

So here it is, our first continent! It may not look like much on its own, but it can make for a very good basis when it comes to scaling the rest of the map, and see how other continents can be shaped going from it. In a way, continents are quite like a jigsaw puzzle after all, and you can take advantage of that. Going on from that continent, let us add some more things.

Here we have more parts. Now, this is where things get really interesting, as you, the creator of this world in the making, will be able to decide why it is that things are the way they are, either by scientific explanations or by making the most of the genre you&#39;re chosen.

For example, let&#39;s take a look at the four smaller continents at the top part of the map. A peculiar thing about it is that it seems as though there should be a fifth part, in the middle. Now, one could go on in several ways about it. Being prosaic and down to earth, for example, and rooting that fact in geologic disasters, tectonic movements and such that would have ended up in the fifth part sinking down into the ocean. Another method would be to use the genre, in this case Fantasy, and use it as a basis. As such, maybe the fifth part was separated from its other parts due to a fight between beasts of mythical power?

This isn&#39;t to say that one method is better than the other though. I would say, your choice should be hinged onto what you are most interested in.

Now, I could go on and on with continents, but I would end up repeating myself, so let us go onward, draw more things on this map, and work from there.

We have a lot more to work with now, don&#39;t we? Not only did I add more continents, I also added ice caps to the poles, and segmented most landmasses. The idea here is that it gives more points for the eye to grab onto, and it is also very helpful when it comes to getting ideas. As such, maybe a given line is a mountain chain, while another is a river, another one is a political frontier and so on.

Moreover, given that this map is for a fantasy world, you can also come up with all kinds of ideas to explain why things look the way they are. Indeed, while you can follow the principles of tectonic movements, you can very well have it so that some, if not all continents have a stranger origin than just underground movement.

There is a game called Dragon Marked for Death that does that in an interesting way.

As you can see, all of the continents put together form a distinctly draconic shape, for these came to be when a dragon-like deity was vanquished and fell unto the world below. In a way, the continents are formed by its corpse.

 This is, of course, not to say that one should have such an epic and over the top way to explain how continents came to be, but it is an interesting twist.

 Though on that note, I would like to point out something that will be increasingly important as we go on: one should go into as much detail as they feel like and can put up with, that sort of thing should not be forced.

As so, if you feel like going deep into your world&#39;s origin, then by all means please do, but if you would rather be brief, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that.

On that, I will be concluding this first part of the World Building Chronicle! Next time we will zoom in, and talk about making a country!
