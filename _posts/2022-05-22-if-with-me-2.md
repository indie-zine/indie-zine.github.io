###### This part is going to be divided into two sections. First I’m going to just talk a little storytelling with you. We’re going to write our opening passage, set the scene, and establish our motivation. Then I’m going to introduce you to some of the different kinds of choices you can make, with examples.


# Step 3: The Where and Why

So at first we had this:

![image01]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/001.jpg)

And that’s all well and good, you can just keep going with that. But for a reader, the narrative is what’s going to drive the desire to make more choices. So let’s give our duck a little gravitas.

![image02]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/002.jpg)

We now have an established setting, sliding the reader cozily into the scene, and have established a character with a motivation. The character and their motivation are the driving force after all, it’s their actions, as decided by the reader, that move the plot.
  
This narrative also gives them more information so that the choice to go left and right feels more like a decision than just clicking whichever direction. Now left means the lake. And perhaps lake means duck-food? Or is it better to find insects in the grass? The wheels are already turninggggg. You can make your narrative be as sparse or descriptive as you like, but remember the main goal is to contextualise the reader’s choices, so they feel like they have a point to them. Don’t just give the reader a choice without at least hinting at its existence in the narrative.**

# Step 4: The How (Again)

Let’s talk CHOICES. I’ve shown you how to make the most basic choice, which is a link that you click that takes you to another passage. It is a physical action on the part of the character, and it’s the most basic form of player interaction. You can do the whole game like this and it never needs to get more complicated. But if you want a little more nuance, here’s something you can do.

**Use variables.**

If you don’t know, a variable is a way for the game to track choices that could affect the story later on. Like whether you have an inventory item, or whether you were rude to your mother before going to school. As an example, I am going to check if you are carrying a stick.

In twine, variables work like this:

First establish your variable using this format: <<set $stick to false>> This is a binary choice. You either have stick or you don’t, and right now you are stickless.

If you say <<set $stick to 0>> instead, this implies there are multiple sticks that could be collected. Both are valid options. Right now you are still stickless.

The $stick variable now exists. It can be modified or checked as you please. Let’s change its value by adding a new choice.

![image03]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/003.jpg)

As you can see, I’ve established my variable in my opening passage. Try to do this on the same line as your narrative, or during play you’ll find weird line breaks where Twine knows it shouldn’t show the code, but is still acting like there’s something there.

Now in the new passage, let’s write <<set $stick to true>>, and then feed back into our original left and right options so we can be on our merry way. In possession of an item, what crimes will we commit?

Well none yet, because you have to create scenarios for that item first. There’s a few ways you can do this. You can have the narrative reflect that you are carrying a stick, have other characters react to your stick, and unlock choices that you can only take if you have a stick. I will show you all three.

All these options follow the same pattern. You check if $stick is true. The format goes: <<if $stick is true>> new sticky content<</if>>. Any content that is only present with the stick gets wrapped in the if statement. You can copy this directly into your passage and modify it as you please.

Having the narrative reflect your choice is mostly a cosmetic option, but it feels nice for a reader to see a concrete change that they were responsible for. (It may also be a memory aid for readers who Do Not Remember Picking Up the Thing) So this:

Can become this:

![image04]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/004.jpg)

Or this:

![image05]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/005.jpg)

In the same way, if there was another character present, they might react in a new way, but only if $stick is true.

![image06]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/006.jpg)

Well so much for foraging for fish.

You might decide to search the mud around the lake for tasty treats. In such a situation, if you have a stick, you might be more successful, digging up snails that you wouldn’t have been able to before. In such a case, not having the stick could result in simply: It’s too difficult, if only you had something to dig with, which might clue a player in to the fact that the stick is a necessary tool to progress.

But maybe the stick isn’t necessary! Maybe you can do fine without it, but having it just unlocks an alternate route to the same story, or gives you fun optional things to do. In this case we want to hide options unless you have the required tool. Using the same if-statement format, we can hide a choice inside it like this:

![image07]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/007.jpg)

One choice available for the stickless, both for the worthy! If you exit the passage, you’ll notice your plan now contains both choice possages. But for the player, the digging in mud option will only be visible and selectable if they have the tool for it, otherwise all they can do is jump in the lake (or any other ‘obvious’ option you want to include). This allows you to encourage your players into exploration and trying out new combinations, adding more ‘meat’ to your story without necessarily adding a new passage for every single little choice and making it too horizontal to deal with.

But what if I don’t want picking up the stick to lead to a new passage. Seems like a waste to go to ‘got a stick’ just to come back to square one. Let me introduce you to one more Twine trick.

linkreplace allows you to click a choice and then not leave the passage. Revolutionary, I know. The format for the choice is a little different, but I’ll show it to you and you can just copy it exactly, modifying it to your needs.

![image08]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/008.jpg)

What this means is that clicking the ‘Pick up Stick’ option is going to give you some text, set $stick to true, and then do nothing until you choose to go left or right. Much more elegant! Let’s see that in action.

And if we go to the lake

![image11]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-05-22-if-with-me-2/011.jpg)

The narrative, characters, and even a newly revealed choice all speak of you having a stick.

Variables and linkreplace in conjunction are excellent ways to reduce bouncing from passages unless you need to, and also means you can make several choices on the same page. A character could pick every item of their outfit before they leave the house, without staring at a blank passage that just says [[shirt]], five choices in, and trying to remember if they’re in a closet or at the store. Especially if there’s too much choice just for the sake of choice. We don’t want players to feel like they’re spending too much time on choices that don’t matter.

This ended up quite detailed but these are VERY IMPORTANT TOOLS. As homework, use linkreplace and a couple of variables in your opening passage to give your character Things, and then think of ways to incorporate those Things in the very next passage.
